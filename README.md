 Smart Camera Assistant App Design
 Welcome to the HiCam app design project! This project aims to address the challenge of constantly monitoring CCTV visuals for security and inspection purposes, which can be difficult and unsanitary for humans. Our solution is a camera system with voice assistance and Alexa skills, which can answer questions and provide alerts based on recorded or live visuals that hold information.
